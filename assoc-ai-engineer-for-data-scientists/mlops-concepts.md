# Introduction to MLOps
- ML Ops
    - Practices and tools to deliver software applications
    - Development and Operation used to be separate
## Different phases in MLOps
- Design
    - Context of problem
    - added value
    - business requirements
    - key metrics
    - data processing
- Development
    - Develop machine learning model
    - experiment with data, algorithms, and hyperparameters
    - model ready for deployment
- Deployment
    - integrate the machine learning model in buisiness
    - deploying the model in production
    - monitoring the performance
## Roles in MLOps
